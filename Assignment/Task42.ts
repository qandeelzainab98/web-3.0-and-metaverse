//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magician’s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.



function showMagicians(magicians: string[]): void {
    for (const magician of magicians) {
        console.log(magician);
    }
}
function makeGreat(magicians: string[]): string[] {
    const greatMagicians: string[] = magicians.map((magician) => magician + " the Great");
    return greatMagicians;
}

  
const magiciansArray: string[] = ["ABC", "XYZ"];

const greatMagiciansArray = makeGreat(magiciansArray);

showMagicians(greatMagiciansArray);
